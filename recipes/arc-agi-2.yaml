  ARC-AGI-2 is a benchmark designed to stress test the efficiency and capability
  of state-of-the-art AI reasoning systems. The tasks challenge AI systems on
  symbolic interpretation, compositional reasoning, and contextual rule application—
  areas where current models struggle despite humans solving every task.

    High reproducibility for using the benchmark, but creating similar
    tasks would require significant human effort and testing infrastructure.
