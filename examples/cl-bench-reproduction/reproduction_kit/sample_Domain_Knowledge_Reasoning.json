It was a nuclear power\nplant that released large amounts of radiation into the\nenvironment after an accident. While the people nearby left\nthe area, the wildlife remained. Many plants and animals\ndied because of the high levels of radiation. But others, such\nas tree frogs, adapted. We collected tree frogs from different\nareas surrounding the Chernobyl power plant. We analyzed\ntheir skin coloration. We found that the frogs closer to the\npower plant had darker skin coloration. That’s because they\nhave higher levels of melanin. Melanin is known to protect\norganisms from radiation. We think that darker colored frogs\nbetter survived the higher levels of radiation closer to the\npower plant.\nAuthors:\nPablo Burraco and Germán Orizaola\nAssociate Editors:\nAllison Gamzon and Rachel Watson\nA. An Eastern tree frog.\nB. Reactor 4 at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in Ukraine, which caused the\nrelease of radiation in 1986. On top of it is the New Safe Confinement, a structure\ndesigned to contain the radioactive ruins of the reactor.\nA\nB\nIn April 1986, the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in Ukraine\nmalfunctioned. One of the reactors melted down, causing\nan explosion and fires. The Chernobyl disaster led to the\nlargest release of radioactive material to the environment\nin human history.\nRadioactive elements are elements that have unstable\nnuclei. Examples include uranium and plutonium. These\nelements have a large number of neutrons compared to\nprotons in their nucleus. To become stable, these elements\nbreak apart into new elements. When they do, they release\nlarge amounts of energy. They also release radiation\nas small particles, known as alpha particles. At high\nlevels, radiation can cause the death of an organism. At\nlower levels, radiation can cause changes to an organism’s\nbody and can lead to DNA changes. Because radiation can\nnegatively impact wildlife, it is a form of pollution.\nWhile tragic, the Chernobyl accident provided scientists with\nan opportunity – to study the effects of radiation on wildlife.\nWe wanted to explore how wildlife adapted to radiation. In\nparticular, we wanted to learn about skin coloration in tree\nfrogs. Skin coloration is caused by different pigments.\nDiscussion\nRadiation, like all forms of pollution, impacts wildlife.\nYou can help minimize the impact of pollution! Do your\npart to reduce the amount of pollution that enters the\nenvironment. Use public transportation, walk, or ride your\nbike to reduce the amount of air pollution. To reduce water\npollution, throw your garbage away rather than leave it on\nthe ground. Reduce, reuse, recycle, and repurpose items so\nthat they don’t end up in a landfill. Through conservation,\nyou can help reduce the need for wildlife to adapt to\npollution.\nIt is not easy being small. Especially when nature seems to\nfavor larger individuals. But why don’t all animals evolve to\nbe bigger? Is it sometimes better to be small? Or are some\nincapable of evolving?\nTo answer these questions, we studied a wild population of\nsnow voles (a small rodent species) in their alpine habitat.\nGenetic analysis indicated a hidden evolutionary change:\nvoles evolved to become smaller but the average body size\nof population stayed the same. To understand the underlying\ncauses, we separated genetic and environmental influences\non vole body size.\nWe found that young voles with genes for small bodies\ndeveloped faster. This allowed them to survive better when\nenvironmental conditions changed (earlier arrival of winter).\nAs a result, the population evolved towards a smaller body\nsize. Our study shows that populations can evolve rapidly. But\nwithout a genetic perspective and understanding the underlying\ncauses, we may not be able to detect these changes.\nIntroduction\nAbstract\nDo you ever wonder why organisms seem to fit their\nenvironments? It happens through an often slow and\ngradual process called adaptive evolution. It has a key\nrole in shaping long-term features of wild plant and animal\npopulations. Individuals that survive and reproduce pass on\ntheir genes to future generations, while the genes of those\nthat do not survive and reproduce are eliminated. Over\nmultiple generations of elimination, a.k.a. natural selection,\ngenes that improve survival and reproduction become more\ncommon in the gene pool of the population.\nHuman-induced climate change impacts environmental\nconditions all around the world. Adaptive evolution might\nhelp animals and plants fit their new environment and avoid\nextinction. But we still do not know how common or how fast\nit is in nature, because it is hard to see adaptive evolution\nin action. For example, body size is influenced by genes (it\nis passed on from generation to generation) but also by the\nenvironment (individuals who are better fed when young will\ngrow up to be bigger). So if we see that larger animals have\nmore offspring, why don’t we see the average snow vole\nwithin the population evolving to be larger?\nThere are two possible answers:\n1) The population is really not evolving\n(evolutionary stasis)\nOr:\n2) Adaptation is happening, but the genetic changes\nare swamped out by environmental changes. (Better fed\nindividuals grow larger, even if they have genes for small\nbodies).\nBecause body size is a quantitative trait (which means it\ndepends on the cumulative actions of many genes and the\nenvironment), we need more effective methods to separate\nthe effects of these two factors.\nOur genetic study of a wild snow vole population revealed\nadaptive evolution in action towards a smaller and lighter\nbody size. Due to the isolated location of their habitat,\nnatural selection (and not immigration) was the main cause\nof this evolutionary change.\nTo understand why nature selected small voles over large\nones, we separated effects of genes and the environment on\nvole body size. We discovered that young voles with genes\nfor large bodies require a longer development time. When\nsnow fell earlier in the season, these individuals could not\ncomplete their development in time and died. On the other\nhand, young voles with genes for small bodies were more\nlikely to develop before the winter came and food became\nscarce. Therefore they survived better and were fitter\ncompared to their counterparts.\nAnd here comes the tricky part: Over the same decade, the\nnumber of voles in the population decreased. Thus, more\nfood was probably available for the remaining animals, and\nthey grew bigger. This kept the average body size of the\npopulation the same, even though the voles were evolving\nto be smaller in the long run. As a result, genetic change\ntowards small body size wasn’t visible from the outside. If\nwe restricted our study to simply measuring the change in\naverage body size, we couldn’t have exposed this adaptive\nevolution in action that was going on at the genetic level.\nDiscussion\nWhen environments are changing, wild animals and plants\nface the risk of extinction. In this study, we used genetic\nmethods to reveal a rare case of hidden adaptive evolution.\nAdaptive evolution can help species cope with changing\nclimatic conditions.\nOur understanding of evolutionary dynamics is vital in\npredicting when or if evolution will occur and in identifying\nevolutionary winners and losers. We can use this information\nto preserve species that cannot adapt. Down the line, we can\nincorporate evolutionary processes into wildlife management\nprograms and minimize biodiversity loss due to rapid climate\nchange.\nThe Earth is getting warmer, and we can already see\nproblems from it. Floods, storms, and deserts are all getting\nworse. People, animals, and plants all have to make changes\nif we want to survive.\nMale dragonflies use dark coloring on their wings to attract\nfemales. It also helps them scare off other males. We\nwanted to know if this dark coloring might change as the\nclimate gets warmer. We created a database to compare\ndragonflies living in warm climates to dragonflies living in\ncooler climates.\nWe found that male dragonflies living in warmer climates\nhave smaller and lighter areas of dark color on their wings.\nThis is because the darker coloring can make the dragonfly\ntoo hot. (It’s hard to be active when you’re in a hot place\nwith warm clothes on, right?) Less or lighter coloring is more\nhelpful for the dragonflies in warmer climates.\nHow will dragonflies adapt\n to a warmer Earth?\nAuthors:\nMichael P. Moore, Kaitlyn Hersch,\nChanont Sricharoen, and others\nAssociate editors:\nAllison Gamzon and Alexandra Appleton\nAuthors:\nMichael P. Moore, Kaitlyn Hersch,\nChanont Sricharoen, and others\nAssociate editors:\nAllison Gamzon and Alexandra Appleton\nWith the world getting warmer, it’s important to know how\nanimals deal with this change. Even humans can’t survive\nif it gets too cold or too hot! As temperatures go up, some\nspecies migrate to new locations with lower temperatures.\nOther species are able to adapt to the warmer temperatures\nin their environment by changing what traits they have.\nMany animals have ornamental coloration. That’s a\nscientific way of saying they use different colors and designs\nto attract mates. It can also scare off any other animals\nwho might want to take their mate. We decided to look\nat dragonflies because the males have dark ornamental\ncoloration on their wings.\nThe darker the male’s coloring, the more successful he is at\nattracting a mate. But this same dark coloring also changes\nhis body temperature: it takes in more energy from the sun,\nmaking his body temperature go up. Females also have\nornamental coloration, but they spend more time in the\nshade looking for food, so they don’t have a chance to heat\nup as much. \nMale and female dragonflies did not change in the same\nway when the temperatures got warmer. This is because\nthey have different roles. (Remember, female dragonflies\nspend more time in the shade looking for food.) We\ncannot assume that the males and females of any species\nwill adapt in exactly the same way when they face new\nenvironments.\nThe ornamental coloration on male dragonflies’ wings is\nless and lighter in warmer climates. Scientists expect the\nclimate to become warmer over the next 70 years. So, the\nornamental coloration on male dragonflies’ wings will most\nlikely need to become even less/lighter. If that continues,\nthe way they attract mates might change over time, too.\nOther animals also use dark ornamental coloration to\nattract mates. So, we expect similar changes as they adapt\nto warmer temperatures.\nThe Earth’s climate is changing. Some species will change\nto adapt to a warmer world. Why do we care? As plants\nand animals change, the other plants and animals they\nare connected to also have to change. That means we will\nhave to change the way we live our lives, too.\nTo protect the environment from climate change, we need\nto try to stop the Earth from warming up too much. You can\nhelp by being careful about how much energy and water\nyou use. Take shorter showers, use public transportation or\na bicycle instead of a car, and buy less stuff. Small changes\ncan make a big difference if everyone helps!\nWhat can we learn from fossils? We can estimate the\nshape and size of an extinct animal. Anything else?\nWell, if soft tissues (like the brain or muscles) fossilize,\nit could tell us how the animal functioned or behaved.\nUnfortunately, soft tissue decomposes quickly after an\nanimal dies. They aren’t preserved as fossils very often.\nThat’s why we felt really lucky when we came across\na fossil of an extinct horseshoe crab with a preserved\ncentral nervous system (CNS). We discovered that the\norganization of the CNS in our fossil is the same as\nin horseshoe crabs living today. It hasn’t changed in\nover 300 million years! We also figured out how our\nunique fossil might have formed. This could help others\ndiscover similar fossils in the future.\nHave you ever wondered how you feel pain or\nunderstand what your eyes see? Your central\nnervous system (CNS) controls and processes those\n(and many other) functions in your body. It also plays\na role in your behavior and how you interact with the\nworld around you. It is basically your brain telling you\nwhat to do.\nAs you can imagine, the CNS in many animals is very\ncomplex. One way scientists can study the CNS is by\nlooking at its morphology, or the way it is organized.\nThis can provide a lot of information about the way the\norganism functions.\nPaleontologists can look at the CNS in fossils to see\nhow extinct animals might have functioned or behaved.\nUnfortunately, the CNS is made of a soft material that\ndecays quickly once an animal dies. This means there\naren’t very many fossils where paleontologists can see\nHorseshoe crabs living today are important marine\narthropods. This is a baby Atlantic horseshoe crab\n(Limulus polyphemus). Photo: Joe Reynolds\nSEPTEMBER 2022\nWhat can fossils tell us about the nervous system’s evolution?\n2\nthe CNS. With this gap in the fossil record, it’s hard to\nunderstand how the CNS might have evolved in many\nanimals.\nOne group of animals where this is important is the\narthropods. Arthropods are one of the most diverse\ngroups of organisms. And they have been around for\nmore than 500 million years! You have probably heard\nof some of the most popular arthropods like insects,\nspiders, and crabs.\nWe wanted to know what changes might have happened\nin the CNS of arthropods over time. Luckily, we found a\nfossil of an extinct horseshoe crab where we could see\nthe CNS clearly. We took a closer look at the fossil to:\nlearn about the CNS in this extinct arthropod.\ndiscover the possible taphonomic processes that\nled to the formation of this fossil.\nOur find is exciting because it is the first time we have\nbeen able to examine the complete CNS of an extinct\narthropod that lived in freshwater.\nThe morphology of the CNS in our fossil is very similar\nto the CNS in horseshoe crabs living today. This means\nthat the organization of the nervous system hasn’t\nchanged for at least 300 million years! This extinct\nhorseshoe crab likely functioned and behaved in similar\nways to horseshoe crabs alive today.\nUsually, soft tissues do not preserve well. This fossil\nis unique because the CNS is preserved in kaolinite,\nFigure 1:\nThis is the fossil of the Euproops danae\nhorseshoe crab we studied. The central\nnervous system (CNS) is outlined by a\nwhite box on the fossil. The inset shows\na redrawn version of the CNS.\n3\nSEPTEMBER 2022\nWhat can fossils tell us about the nervous system’s evolution?\nwhich is easy to see. We think this fossil must have\nformed in three steps.\n1. The mineral matrix around the fossil formed very\nfast. The CNS was likely protected by a thick membrane.\n2. The CNS eventually decayed and left a void.\n3. The void was filled in with kaolinite. Kaolinite is\nwhite in color and makes the CNS easy to see.\nWe think there may be examples of soft tissues in\nother Mazon Creek fossils, but they may be hard to\nrecognize. Future studies should look at the color and\ncontours of fossils to help find these preserved tissues.\nConclusion\nFossils give us a snapshot of what happened in the past.\nPaleontologists can even figure out how organisms\nfunctioned and behaved by studying soft tissues like\nthe CNS. It is important to look at fossils so we can\nunderstand how organisms have changed over time\nand how they might change in the future.\nIf you want to see fossils, you can visit your local\nnatural history museum. Or you can take a trip to an\narea like Mazon Creek to hunt for your own fossils. If\nyou find something amazing, make sure to share it\nwith your local museum or paleontologist!"
